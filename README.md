This is a utility that will attempt to automatically collate information about a person. The only interaction the user is involved in is logging into his/her LinkedIn account. 

The utility is meant to be deployed in a web setting. Include the files in a directory that is being served by a webserver equipped with PHP. Direct users to the authentica.php script and our utility will return a JSON response with the person's information.

Here is the information that will be returned:

# LinkedIn profile information (name, email, publications, associated URLs, associations, patents, skills, and education)
# Links to their GitHub, Facebook, StackOverflow, and Twitter found on their personal web page
